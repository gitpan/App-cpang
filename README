NAME
    App::cpang - CPAN GUI in Gtk2

VERSION
    version 0.03

DESCRIPTION
    It's about time we have a GUI for *cpan*. Apparently we're not that into
    GUI, but users are, so we need^Wshould care about it too.

    This is a rough draft of a basic cpan GUI. It uses App::cpanminus
    instead of the basic *cpan*. It's not pretty, but it's a start.

    You are more than welcome to help me work this into a beautiful GUI
    application for users to use in order to search/install/test(?) modules
    and applications from CPAN.

FOR USERS
    If you are a user, please check cpang for how to use this.

    This paper describes the module behind the application.

ATTRIBUTES
    These are the attributes available in "new()".

  title
    Sets the title of the main window.

        use App::cpang;

        my $app = App::cpang->new( title => 'MY MAIN TITLE!' );

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Surprisingly this creates a new object of type App::cpang.

  run
    Packs everything and runs the application.

        $app->run;

   click($event)
    Clicks on the "Install" step. This is bound to an event of the button in
    the interface.
